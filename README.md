# Face Mask Detection

### Project description
The aim of the project was to create an application that detects one of the three states (mask, no mask and incorrectly worn masks) in real time. Unfortunately, due to the insufficient number of photos showing a incorrectly worn masks, the model does not detect this condition. It was created in two variants: .ipynb and .py.

### Data
Data used in the project from the Kaggle portal [data](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)

### Presentation of the application's operation
The operation of the application was presented in the [video](https://youtu.be/jegcj527zGc)

### How to run an application
You will need Python 3.8 and libraries (cv2, numpy, keyboard, imutils, tensorflow) to run the application.
For the application to work, you must download the files located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19z5TKETRr1-QXBMvhOhjVLsd-KHhRKDf?usp=sharing) and put them in the same folder as Application.ipynb or Application.py.
From the Application.ipynb file, run the third cell (the first two can be omitted if you have all the libraries you need) or you can run Application.py.
